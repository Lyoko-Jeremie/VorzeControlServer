A VORZE electric toys `Vorze A10 Cyclone/Piston SA` Remote Control Adapter Server Powered by Boost.Asio


Because i have a VORZE A10 Cyclone SA , but the bad official Android remote control app cannot work on my phone,  
so i try to develop this program to provide a simple web remote control user interface to replace the official bad Android app for myself.

you can use this program under GPL v3 license if you have a VORZE electric toys like me .

The Vorze brand and the SA product listed here are the property of RENDS Co.,Ltd.

This program merely expands their limited video player capabilities, AND their bad mobile phone control app, this is for non-profit and can be used free of charge.

Thanks to [Vorze-PlayerHelper-W](https://github.com/itfitz/Vorze-PlayerHelper-W) , it's a good example to describe how to communicate with VORZE USB Bluetooth Adapter.

Some code are reused from my [Socks5BalancerAsio](https://github.com/Lyoko-Jeremie/Socks5BalancerAsio) project.
